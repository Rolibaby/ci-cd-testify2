# 1a. what are the main features of python
# Python is object-oriented
# Python has Robust standard library
# Python is easy to code, It is a high level programming language yet, it is effortless to learn
# It is easy to read : Python code looks like simple english words
# It is  free and open source, it supports cross-platform
# Python is dynamically typed , that is it does not associate a type to a variable until runtime
# white space is used to denote blocks in python unlike other programming language that uses curly braces
# Python is interpreted which means your program source code is converted to bytecode and executed line by line
# which is then interpreted by Python virtual machine
# Python virtual machine executes the python byte-codes
# Python is portable i.e the same code can be used on differrent machines

# 2. what is the difference between a list and a dictionary in python
# A list is a variable that can store multiple values or items  example
# language = ["Node.js", "C#", "Java", "JavaScript"].
# we use square bracket to declare list in python
# while a dictionary is a collection of key-value pair elements.
# Dictionary elements are created in a curly bracket example
# Vehicle = {
#   "type": "car",
#   "wheel": 4
#   "can_fly": False
#   }

# 3. In your words explain the keyword pass
# It is used as a placeholder for future code.
# 4. What is iterator in Python
# solution:
#An iterator in Python is an object that contains a countable number of elements that can be iterated upon.

# 5. what is unit testing
# unit testing is testing a unit of code in an application to ensure that it works as expected .
# It is a process in software engineering in which most of the smallest and most testable part
# of an application is individually tested to ensure it satisfies their use case

# 6. Of the available unit testing framework in python which is your favourite and why
# unittest is my favorite unit testing framework because it's ease of use

# 7. Name the types of arguments in python
# Required arguments, Default arguments, Keyword arguments,
# Arbitrary arguments, Arbitrary Keyword arguments

# 8. Explain what functions are
# functions are reusable block of code that is executed when called from other part of the program

# 9. How do you create a class in python
# you create a class by using the syntax: class followed by class_name:
# class Vehicle:

# 10. Explain what polymorphism and inheritance is in python OOP
# polymorphism is an OOP capability that  allows a method to perform many functions or logic
# inheritance is an OOP capability that allows a class to derive or inherit attributes and methods
# from another class. the class that derived property is called the Derived class or child class
# while the class from which the property was derived is called the parent class
